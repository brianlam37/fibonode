This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this project?

I wanted a little more experience with web development technology so I looked online for some projects to make.

I found this medium post:
https://medium.com/@carminezaccagnino/top-4-cool-projects-to-build-to-enrich-your-full-stack-web-development-skills-8cbdd3673f43

I figured why not try this out, but I wanted to do the first project using Node.js instead of python since I had the prior experience with it coding Discord bots.

Following that I decided to follow another guide on the MERN stack:
https://medium.com/@beaucarnes/learn-the-mern-stack-by-building-an-exercise-tracker-mern-tutorial-59c13c1237a1

After completing the tutorial and learning more about MERN, I decided to try the first project from the previous medium article. This project didn't require Mongoose/MongoDB and it runs perfectly fine locally.
